Website design for a fictional cafe called the local business cafe
=================================================================
Project description
-------------------
As part of my Codecademy FrontEndPlus course i was tasked with designed a website for a fictional cafe called the local business cafe, the website is designed with a home page which has four sections the home screen, about section, menu section and a contact section.
The about section has a breif description of the 'company', on the menu section there are 3 menus which can be accessed by clicking on the link and the contact section has a phone number and address as well as a link to an enquiry form page.
When accessing one of the 3 menus there will be a table with product, description, image and price shown, you can scroll down through all options and there is a button at the bottom to return to the menu section on the homepage.
The enquiry form page brings up a form which has five feilds which are all required, the first is a name field, the second is a phone number which requires 11 numbers, the third is an email field, the fourth is an enquiry type select box with 5 options and lastly there is a description box which requires a min of 10 characters and a max of 360 characters. Underneath this there is a submit button and a return to home link.
At the bottom of the home page there is an admin access button as a footer of the page, this has been put in place so i can view enquiries which are stored locally from the enquiry form page. (At the time of writing this i have only just learnt how to perform front end development, hopefully in the future i can adapt this when i understand how to perform back end development).
