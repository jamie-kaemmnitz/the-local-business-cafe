Website design for a fictional cafe called the local business cafe
=================================================================
Project description
-------------------
As part of my Codecademy FrontEndPlus course i was tasked with designed a website for a fictional cafe called the local business cafe, the website is designed with a home page which has four sections the home screen, about section, menu section and a contact section.

At the top of each page you will find a header with the Company name on the left hand side and some nav links on the right hand side to the home/ about/ menu and contact us sections, except on the enquiries page where the nav links are intentionally missing. For mobile devices the nav links have been moved into a hamburger menu for easier viewing.

The about section has a breif description of the 'company', on the menu section there are 3 menus which can be accessed by clicking on the link and the contact section has a phone number and address as well as a link to an enquiry form page.

When accessing one of the 3 menus there will be a table with product, description, image and price shown, you can scroll down through all options and there is a button at the bottom to return to the menu section on the homepage.
The enquiry form page brings up a form which has five feilds which are all required, the first is a name field, the second is a phone number which requires 11 numbers, the third is an email field, the fourth is an enquiry type select box with 5 options and lastly there is a description box which requires a min of 10 characters and a max of 360 characters. Underneath this there is a submit button and a return to home link.

At the bottom of the home page there is an admin access button as a footer of the page, this has been put in place so i can view enquiries which are stored locally from the enquiry form page. (At the time of writing this i have only just learnt how to perform front end development, hopefully in the future i can adapt this when i understand how to perform back end development). When clicking the admin access button you will taken to a page which requires a username and a password to enter (the only current working username is 'username1' and the password is 'password2'), you will be informed if either or both oif these have been entered incorrectly. The submit button only works by clicking, currently cannot use enter to accept your fields.

Once you have accessed the enquiries page there will be a list of the current enquiries entered as well as a clear enquiry button for any that have been dealt with. If there are no enquiries you should see a message displaying such. There is a log out button which will take you back to the log in page.

The entire webpage was created using HTML CSS and Javascript.
